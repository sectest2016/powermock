/**
 * A ClassLoaderExecutor can run any code in any classloader. E.g. assume you have a classloader
 * called myClassloader and you want to execute a (void) method called myMethod in myObject using this CL:
 * <pre>
 *     SingleClassloaderExecutor cle = new SingleClassloaderExecutor(myClassloader);
 *     cle.execute(new Runnable() {
 *          public void run() {
 *             myObject.myMethod();
 *          }
 *     });
 * </pre>
 *
 * What happens is that the entire object graph of myObject is deep-cloned into the {@code myClassloader} classloader
 * and then the {@code myObject.myMethod()} is executed.
 * <p>
 * You can also execute methods that return something:
 * <pre>
 *     SingleClassloaderExecutor cle = new SingleClassloaderExecutor(myClassloader);
 *     MyResult result = cle.execute(new Callable<MyResult>() {
 *          public MyResult call() throws Exception {
 *             return myObject.myMethod();
 *          }
 *     });
 * </pre>
 * Here we imagine that {@code myObject.myMethod()} returns an object of type {@code MyResult}. Again the entire
 * state will be deep-cloned to  {@code myClassloader} and then the {@code myObject.myMethod()} is executed.
 * The result of the method call is deep-cloned back into the original classloader (the one that made the call to
 * {@code cle.execute(..)}) and is ready for use.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the SingleClassloaderExecutor requires a deep cloner implementing the {@link DeepClonerSPI} present in the class-path.
 * </p>
